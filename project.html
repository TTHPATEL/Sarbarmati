<h1><u>Project Objectives</u></h1>
<p>The project aims to provide Ahmedabad with a meaningful waterfront environment along the banks of the Sabarmati River and to redefine an identity of Ahmedabad around the river. The project looks to reconnect the city with the river and positively transform the neglected aspects of the riverfront.

The objectives of this multidimensional project can be categorised under three topics :</p>

<h2>Environmental Improvement</h2>
<p>Strategies for overall environmental improvement have been formulated to achieve the following objectives :-</p>
<h5>Reduction in Erosion and Flood</h5>

<p>Strategies for flood protection, bank protection, and river training have been formulated based on detailed hydrological and hydraulic analysis and an optimal width of 263 meters for the water way has been selected.

Strategies for flood protection, bank protection, and river training have been formulated based on detailed hydrological and hydraulic analysis. An optimal width of 263 meters for the water way has been selected and implemented. Both banks of the river have diaphragm walls built into the riverbed at a depth of more than 10m, and retaining walls which protect low-lying areas from periodic flooding and prevent erosion of the river banks. The Sabarmati has been channelized to a constant width without altering the flood carrying capacity of the river. Now the project can sustain flood levels of 4.75 lac cusecs without spillage into the city.</p>



<h2>Social Upliftment</h2>
<p>The project master plan aims at improving and providing social facilities for the city with the following objectives:</p>
<h5>Creation of Parks & Public Spaces</h5>

<p>The project aims at transforming Ahmedabad’s riverfront to reconnect the city with its river. By reclaiming around 202 hectares of riverbed land on both sides of the river, for a length of nearly twelve kilometres, the project replaces a largely private riverfront with a public realm that will connect an expansive network of parks and promenades for the city’s five million residents to enjoy.

One of the key features of this project is a two-level, continuous promenade at the water’s edge along each bank of the river. The lower level promenade has a minimum width of six meters. It has been built just above the water level to serve pedestrians and cyclists and to provide access to the water. The upper level river promenade is being built to host a variety of public features: few areas for commercial and retail development, leisure activities, large parks and plazas, public washrooms and retail kiosks. Together, these promenades provide Ahmedabad with a 11.5 km long pedestrian walkway in the heart of the city. Ghats punctuate the lower level promenade at planned intervals to provide access to the water for recreational and cultural activities.

Over a quarter of the reclaimed land has been designated for parks and plazas. The parks will provide much needed green open spaces that will serve the adjacent neighbourhoods as well as strengthen the city's green network. Few of the significant projects that have emerged from this objective are:
Riverfront Park: Subhash Bridge
Riverfront Park: Usmanpura
River Promenade</p>



<h2>Sustainable Development</h2>
<p>The project master plan aims at making the development sustainable in all aspects with the following objectives:</p>
<h5>Revitalisation of Neighbourhoods</h5>

<p>It also aims to bring new life to the centre of the city and to spur broad-based upgradation and revitalisation of surrounding neighbourhoods.

The project aims to bring new life to the centre of the city and to spur broad-based revitalisation of surrounding neighbourhoods. The land uses of the reclaimed areas in the master plan have been allocated in relation to the existing land use of the adjacent areas. Eighteen precincts have been identified in the project which will undergo gradual upgradation to benefit residents and workers in central Ahmedabad by promoting integrated, high-density growth, with a focus on walkability and public transportation.</p>
