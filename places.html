<h1>River Promenade</h1>
<p>The key feature of this project is a two-level, continuous promenade at the water’s edge along each bank of the river. The lower-level promenade is built just above the water level to serve pedestrians and cyclists, and to provide access to the water. The upper level promenade shall host a variety of public features at the city level. Together these provide Ahmedabad with an uninterrupted, pedestrian walkway, nearly 11.5km in length, in the heart of the city.</p>

<h5>The width of the promenade varies from 6-18m. Facilities provided at the River Promenade include:</h5>

<li>Access points from the city level via staircases and ramps at regular intervals and under every bridge.</li>
<br>
<li>Lifts or Elevators to make lower-level promenade accessible for people with disabilities.</li>
<br>
<li>Ghats at key locations to enable continuation of cultural activities.</li>
<br>
<li>Boating facilities with a boating station.</li>
<br>
<li>Public washrooms at regular intervals.</li>
<br>
<li>Concrete paved flooring which can support walking, jogging and cycling.</li>
<br>
<li>Evenly spaced lighting along the length of the promenade.</li>
<br>
<li>Circular concrete seating around the trees and provision of dustbins at regular intervals.</li>
<br>
<li>Platforms at regular intervals for regulated and organized vending activities.</li>
<br>
<li>Security arrangements to handle entry-exit, timings and emergencies.</li>
